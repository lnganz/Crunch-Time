# Crunch Time

Crunch Time is a simple Calorie conversion Android app. You can select an exercise, enter the number of completed reps or minutes, and see how many Calories were burned.


You can also convert between exercises to find how much of one exercise is equivalent to another (e.g. 12 minutes of jogging burns the same number of Calories as 100 Pullups).
